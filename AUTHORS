shUnit2
=======

The unit testing framework used by 'dev' is shUnit2, by Kate Ward
<sfsetse@users.sourceforge.net>.  It is available at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/shunit2
The file test/shunit2 is copied directly from this distribution.

Quilt
=====

Dev is structurally based on quilt; as such, much of the
structual code comes directly from that application.
