= Overview =
Extensions provide actual functionality within the DevFramework.  The BaseExtension provides subcommands to manipulate projects and tasks, while other extensions provide additional functionality related to specific applications or services.

= Structure =
An extension is represented in the source tree by a subdirectory of {{{extensions}}} named after the extension itself.  That subdirectory can optionally contain:
  * {{{defaults.sh}}}: default values for configuration variables
  * {{{functions.sh}}}: functions for use in TaskConfiguration or in subcommands
  * subcommands: new subcommands
  * {{{lib/}}}: arbitrary library files

= Building =
work in progress..

= Loading =
The components of extensions are loaded at different times.  {{{defaults.sh}}} is loaded before {{{.devrc}}} is loaded.  {{{functions.sh}}} is loaded when the extension is {{{require}}}d, whether from a subcommand, a {{{.taskrc}}}, or another extension.

When an extension is {{{require}}}d, Dev sets {{{$EXTNAME_LIB}}} (where EXTNAME is the name of the extension, with underscores) to the full path of the extension's {{{lib/}}} dir, if it exists.
