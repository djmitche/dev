= 'dev' command =
The central interface to Dev is through the 'dev' command and its subcommands.  The following subsections describe the environment that 'dev' sets up for its subcommands.

== .devrc ==
The file {{{.devrc}}} serves two purposes:  It marks the ProjectDirectory, and contains the Dev configuration for that project.  It is __sourced__ as a shell script before the subcommand is started, so it should follow shell-programming conventions for quoting, etc.

The configuration file can set the following variables:
  * {{{$DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH}}}: a colon-separated list of directories containing Dev subcommands.  The default value is {{{$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/dev/subcommands}}}.
  * {{{$DEV_TASKS_DIR}}}: the directory in which task configuration is stored.  The default value is {{{$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/dev/tasks}}}.

Any other variables set in {{{.devrc}}} will be available to subcommands, and can provide configuration for them.  For example, many extensions are configured with variables set in {{{.devrc}}}.

== Variables ==
The 'dev' command sets the following variables before starting a subcommand. All of these variables are exported, and thus available to any other programs started from a subcommand.
  * {{{$DEV_PROJECT_DIR}}}: the current ProjectDirectory
  * {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR}}}: the current TaskDirectory, or an empty string if none was found
  * {{{$DEV_TASK}}}: the name of the current task
  * {{{$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR}}}: the TaskConfiguration directory for the current task
