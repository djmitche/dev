#summary Description of the Dev framework, apart from extensions

= 'dev' command =
The central interface to Dev is through the 'dev' command and its subcommands.  The following subsections describe the environment that 'dev' sets up for its subcommands.

== .devrc ==
The file {{{.devrc}}} serves two purposes:  It marks the top-level directory for a project, and contains the Dev configuration for that project.  It is __sourced__ as a shell script, so it should follow shell-programming conventions for quoting, etc.

The configuration file can set the following variables:
  * {{{DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH}}}: a colon-separated list of directories containing Dev subcommands.  The default value is {{{$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/dev/subcommands}}}.
  * {{{DEV_TASKS_DIR}}}: the directory in which tasks are stored.  The default value is {{{$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/dev/tasks}}}.

Any other variables set in {{{.devrc}}} will be available to subcommands, and can provide configuration for them.  For example, many extensions are configured with variables set in {{{.devrc}}}.

== Variables ==
The 'dev' command sets the following variables. All of these variables are exported, and thus available to any other programs started from a subcommand.
  * {{{DEV_PROJECT_DIR}}}: the top-level directory of the current project, discovered by searching outward from the current directory for a directory containing {{{.devrc}}}.
  *
