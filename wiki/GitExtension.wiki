#summary Git Source Management Extension

The *git* extension provides a loader to handle git repositories, including initial clones.

Note that, unlike with Subversion or Mercurial, in most cases several tasks can
be accomplished in the same working copy, making Dev's task loader less useful.
In many cases, it's enough to use

{{{
load_task() {
	load git
}
}}}

which will initialize a fresh working copy for the task.  Then add any required
remotes and start hacking!

= Loader =

Add a line like
{{{
load_task() {
	load git git://github.com/buildbot/buildbot.git
}
}}}
optionally appending a subdirectory of the task dir that you would like to clone into.

If you do not want to clone an external repository, use
{{{
load_task() {
	load git
	# or
	load git - sub/directory
}
}}}
Both initialize an empty git repository; the second does so in `sub/directory`.
