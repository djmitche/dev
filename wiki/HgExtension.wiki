#summary Mercurial Source Management Extension

The *hg* extension provides a loader to handle source cloned from Mercurial repositories.

= Loader =

Add a line like
{{{
SOURCES=" ...
	hg http://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot
... "
}}}

Or, to load the given URL at a subdirectory of the task directory,
{{{
SOURCES=" ...
	hg http://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot sub/directory
... "
}}}

= Variables =

You can optionally set `HG_CACHE_DIR` to a directory in which cached
repositories will be stored.  When source is loaded, it is first updated in the
cache (cloning from the original if necessary), and then the cache is cloned to
the task directory.  The result is a significant savings in load on the server
and, if hg is doing its job right, a significant savings on on-disk storage, as
the clone operation uses hard links.
