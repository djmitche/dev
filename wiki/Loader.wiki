Loaders implement various means of getting source code into a task directory.  These means are provided by extensions, so see DevExtensions for information on the specific loaders that are available.

== Invocation ==
Loaders are invoked through a special syntax in the {{{SOURCES}}} variable in a TaskConfiguration.

== Implementation ==
Loaders are implemented as shell scripts, stored in {{{$(loaderdir)}}}, which define a single function, {{{load_FOO}}} where {{{FOO}}} is the name of the loader.  For example, a hypothetical wikipedia loader would look like the following, stored in {{{$(loaderdir)/wikipedia}}}:
{{{
load_wikipedia() {
  article="$1"
  destination="${2-.}
  # load the article into $destination ...
}
}}}
and would be invoked as
{{{
SOURCES="
  wikipedia Bean_Hollow_State_Beach
"
}}}

The actual invocation of loaders is handled by the {{{load}}} subcommand of the {{{BaseExtension}}}.
