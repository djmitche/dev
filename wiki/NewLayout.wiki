#summary Ideas for a new layout configuration

= Thoughts =
  * most tasks just have a single dir (usually cwd), or at most a VC line + quilt
  * is it really necessary to support `dev unload`?

= Ideas =
== `layout` file ==
{{{
src svn <URL>
src quilt
wiki svn <URL>
}}}
where order is reversed for unloading.
