#summary Extension to interact with 'patchwork quilt'
[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt Patchwork Quilt] is a patch-authoring tool originally written by Andrew Morton, and heavily modified since.

This extension supports preparation of patches to other projects using quilt.

= Status =

This extension is still under development, and is not yet completely functional.

= Setup =
At the moment, because of the way quilt reads its configuration, the following snippet must be included either in `/etc/quilt.quiltrc` or `$HOME/.quiltrc` in order for quilt to function properly:

{{{
# Load quiltrc for the current task
eval `dev var 2>/dev/null`
if test -n "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR" -a -f "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR/quiltrc"; then
    source "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR/quiltrc"
fi
}}}

= Loader =
Add a line like
{{{
load_task() {
	quilt
}
}}}
to set up the base of the task directory for use with quilt.  To set up a subdirectory, use
{{{
load_task() {
	quilt sub/dir
}
}}}

Then use the 'quilt' command as usual.
