#summary Extension to interact with 'patchwork quilt'
[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt Patchwork Quilt] is a patch-authoring tool originally written by Andrew Morton, and heavily modified since.

This extension supports preparation of patches to other projects using quilt.

= Setup =
At the moment, because of the way quilt reads its configuration, the following snippet must be included either in `/etc/quilt.quiltrc` or `$HOME/.quiltrc` in order for quilt to function properly:

{{{
# Load quiltrc for the current task
eval `dev var 2>/dev/null`
if test -n "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR" -a -f "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR/quiltrc"; then
    source "$DEV_TASK_CONFIG_DIR/quiltrc"
fi
}}}
