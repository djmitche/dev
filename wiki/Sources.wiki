#summary The syntax of the SOURCES configuration variable.
The most critical configuration variable in a TaskType is `SOURCES` -- it defines the structure of as TaskDirectory of that type, and where to get the relevant sources.  

This is a multi-line variable, where each line specifies a [Loader] (in the first word) and its arguments (any remaining words).  A simple task might consist of
{{{
SOURCES="svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"
}}}
while a more complicated task might instead read
{{{
SOURCES="svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  mkdir test_results
  quilt"
}}}
in the latter case, the loaders are {{{svn}}}, {{{mkdir}}}, and {{{quilt}}}.  Loaders are provided by DevExtensions, and are listed alphabetically in LoaderIndex.

There is currently no provision for project-specific loaders.  If you are interested in this feature, add a star to issue 36.

~~Dev aims to use only portable shell, but mulitiline strings are not portable.  This will be fixed in Issue 35.~~
