#summary Subversion Source Management Extension

= Introduction =

The *svn* extension provides functions to handle source checked out of Subversion repositories.

= Task Functions =

Three task functions are provided:

== svn_checkout ==
{{{
svn_checkout URL [DIRECTORY]
}}}
Check out URL into DIRECTORY, a subdirectory of the task directory.  If DIRECTORY is omitted, the checkout is done into the task directory itself -- this is the most common arrangement.

== svn_unload ==
{{{
svn_unload [DIRECTORY]
}}}
Unload a directory loaded with `svn_checkout`; if DIRECTORY is omitted, it defaults to the task directory itself.

== svn_status ==
{{{
svn_status [DIRECTORY]
}}}
Display the status of a directory loaded with `svn_checkout`

= Lookaside Cache =

If the project variable SVN_CACHE_DIR is defined in `.devrc`, then the extension will store unmodified working copies under SVN_CACHE_DIR, and use those to speed subsequent checkouts.
