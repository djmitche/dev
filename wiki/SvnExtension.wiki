#summary Subversion Source Management Extension

The *svn* extension provides a loader to handle source checked out of Subversion repositories.

= Loader =

Add a line like
{{{
load_task() {
	svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}
}}}

Or, to load the given URL at a subdirectory of the task directory,
{{{
load_task() {
	svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sub/directory
}
}}}

= Variables =

You can optionally set `SVN_CACHE_DIR` to a directory in which cached checkouts
will be stored.  When source is loaded, it is first checked out or (better)
updated in this cache, and then copied quickly to the task directory, saving
load on the server.
