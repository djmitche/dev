A task configuration is, like all _dev_ configuration files, just a shell script.  For most uses, it will contain only variable assignments, adding to any configuration found in the ProjectDirectory.

== Loading Source ==
A task must minimally specify how to load the source code it contains.  This is accomplished through the "SOURCES" variable.  This is a multi-line variable, where each line specifies a [Loader] and its arguments.  A simple task might consist of
{{{
SOURCES="svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"
}}}
while a more complicated task might instead read
{{{
SOURCES="svn https://dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  mkdir test_results
  quilt"
}}}
in the latter case, the loaders are {{{svn}}}, {{{mkdir}}}, and {{{quilt}}}.

== Configuration Variables ==
Configuration can be supplied in the form of variables.  Such variables can also be defined in the ProjectDirectory's {{{.devrc}}} if they are global to the project.  For example:
{{{
QUILT_PATCH_DIR="$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/patches"
DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH="$DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH:$DEV_TASK_DIR/subcommands"
}}}

= Finding the Task Configuration =
Given a TaskDirectory, Dev determines the name of the associated task by reading {{{.task}}} in the root of the TaskDirectory.  This file contains a single word, the name of the task.
