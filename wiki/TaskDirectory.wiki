#summary Description of the task directory

The task directory is the top-level directory containing all of the files related to the current task.

Its location is available to subcommands in {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR}}}.  If no task can be found (perhaps because one is not loaded), then this variable is set to the empty string.

= Finding the Task Directory =
Dev finds the task directory by searching outward from the current directory until it reaches a directory containing a file named {{{.task}}}.

= Contents of the Task Directory =
A task directory must contain {{{.task}}}, which gives the name of the task associated with this task directory.

Beyond this, the contents of the task directory are up to the user.  Two layouts are common.  The first is an immediate checkout of the source:
{{{
$DEV_TASK_DIR/.task
$DEV_TASK_DIR/Makefile
$DEV_TASK_DIR/main.c
...
}}}

The second layout contains the source in a subdirectory:
{{{
$DEV_TASK_DIR/.task
$DEV_TASK_DIR/src/Makefile
$DEV_TASK_DIR/src/main.c
$DEV_TASK_DIR/test/test-results.txt
$DEV_TASK_DIR/prefix/bin/myprog
$DEV_TASK_DIR/prefix/lib/myprog.a
...
}}}
This layout is most useful when coupled with project-specific subcommands that need extra task-specific directories to do their work.  The TaskConfiguration for such a layout might look like
{{{
SOURCES="
  svn https://myapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ src/
  mkdir test
  mkdir prefix
"
TEST_DIR="$DEV_TASK_DIR/test"
PREFIX="$DEV_TASK_DIR/prefix"
}}}
