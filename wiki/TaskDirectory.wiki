#summary Description of the task directory

The task directory is the top-level directory containing all of the files related to the current task.

It is available to subcommands in {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR}}}.  If no task can be found (perhaps because one is not loaded), then this variable is set to the empty string.

= Finding the Task Directory =
Dev finds the task directory through the following process:
  * If {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR}}} is already set, Dev uses it as-is.
  * If {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR_ID}}} is set, then Dev searches outward from the current directory until it finds a file or directory matching that name.  Directory separators are allowed in this variable.  Examples: 
{{{
DEV_TASK_DIR_ID="ChangeLog"
DEV_TASK_DIR_ID="src/configure.ac"
}}}
  * If {{{$DEV_TASK_DIR_ID}}} is not set, then Dev searches outward from the current directory until it reaches an immediate subdirectory of the ProjectDirectory.

= Contents of the Task Directory =
The contents of the task directory are up to the user.  Two layouts are common: an immediate checkout of the source:
{{{
$DEV_TASK_DIR/Makefile
$DEV_TASK_DIR/main.c
...
}}}
or a checkout into a subdirectory:
{{{
$DEV_TASK_DIR/src/Makefile
$DEV_TASK_DIR/src/main.c
$DEV_TASK_DIR/test/test-results.txt
$DEV_TASK_DIR/prefix/bin/myprog
$DEV_TASK_DIR/prefix/lib/myprog.a
...
}}}
The latter layout is most useful when coupled with project-specific subcommands that need extra task-specific directories to do their work.
