#summary Description of task types
#labels Featured
A Task type defines configuration for one or more tasks.  Most simple projects have only one task type, but as a project becomes more complex, Task types can be defined for new branches or for tasks that require different configuration or build practices.

Task type configuration is, like all Dev configuration files, just a shell script.  For most uses, it will contain only variable assignments, adding to any configuration found in the ProjectDirectory.

= Loading Source =
A Task type must minimally specify how to load the source code it contains.  This is accomplished through the `load_task` function.  It is defined like this
{{{
load_task() {
	# loaders go here
}
}}}
each of the loaders begins with the word `load`, followed by the loader type, and any arguments.  For example:
{{{
load_task() {
	load hg http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central mozilla
}
}}}

The LoaderIndex page contains a complete list of the available loaders.

= Configuration Variables =
Configuration can be supplied in the form of variables.  Such variables can also be defined in the ProjectDirectory's configuration if they are global to the project.  For example:
{{{
QUILT_PATCH_DIR="$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/patches"
DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH="$DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH:$DEV_TASK_DIR/subcommands"
}}}
