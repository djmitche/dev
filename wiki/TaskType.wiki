#summary Description of task types
A Task type defines configuration for one or more tasks.  Most simple projects have only one task type, but as a project becomes more complex, Task types can be defined for new branches or for tasks that require different configuration or build practices.

Task type configuration is, like all Dev configuration files, just a shell script.  For most uses, it will contain only variable assignments, adding to any configuration found in the ProjectDirectory.

= Loading Source =
A Task type must minimally specify how to load the source code it contains.  This is accomplished through the "[Sources SOURCES]" variable.   See [Sources] for more detail on the syntax of this variable.

= Configuration Variables =
Configuration can be supplied in the form of variables.  Such variables can also be defined in the ProjectDirectory's configuration if they are global to the project.  For example:
{{{
QUILT_PATCH_DIR="$DEV_PROJECT_DIR/patches"
DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH="$DEV_SUBCOMMANDS_PATH:$DEV_TASK_DIR/subcommands"
}}}
