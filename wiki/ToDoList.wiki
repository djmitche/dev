#summary Development Notes

= Immediate =
  * taskrc functions should be defined by subcommands, not globally
  * rewrite 'svn' module, etc. to be compliant with docs
  * implicit 'require' of base extension (?)

= Configure =
  * use automake; completely rewrite build process around extensions
    * defaults should get sourced, not cat'd together
  * check for BASH, not sh, etc.  But don't require GNU bash.

= New Stuff =
  * 'dev var DEV_PROJECT_DIR', etc.
  * 'dev setup' command (interactive)
  * dev chlog
  * dev mkpatch 
  * integrate with / subsume into / support 
    * git/stgit
    * bazaar/bzr

= Bugs =
  * make clean doesn't work?
  * general cleanup 
    * where does source_task get called? 
    * when do functions get sourced?
